# BOPN

This repository provides a reference implementation of **BOPN** and pre-trained models as described in the paper:

The code is implemented using **PyTorch**.

---

## Getting Started

This repository includes codes for solving two combinatorial optimization (CO) problems:

- **Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP)**
- **Permutation Flow Shop Problem (PFSP)**

---

## Basic Usage

For both `ATSP_BOPN` and `FFSP_BOPN`, the following steps outline the usage:

### i. Training a Model
To train a model, run the following command:
```bash
python3 train.py
